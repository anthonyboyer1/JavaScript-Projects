# JavaScript-Projects
Here are some things that I put together to get a better understanding how JavaScript is learned. A little bit about myself, I have been coding for about 3 months learning from co-workers to online lessons. I got into coding because my peers throughout my working professional career have mentioned how analytical I am. I figured I could be an implementation specialist or be a Customer Success manager. After looking into coding and realizing that the market in San Francisco is ever growing spot for Software Engineers. I figured it can be a better solution than trying to go to grad school for an MBA, which means carrying another 80k in possible debt. So, below we shall take a journey in some of the basic steps of coding with Java-Script together. I have no computer background and I may run into mistakes but as time goes the code will get better and the examples as well. I hope this can help others who are considering coding as a profession.

This project will: 
1) I will be able to put some examples of some key coding in Java-Script. 
2) Show results and code that could be shown for others to see. 
3) Go through basic fundamentals of code. 
4) With feedback.
